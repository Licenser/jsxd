General
=======
jsxd is a library to sanely work with nested data structures as [jsx](https://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx) produces. The data structures can represent objects (key value lists) or arrays (lists). Be aware that keys in an object are **ordered** based on comparison and not on adding order.

index
-----
* General
  - [Keys](#Keys)
* Functions
  - [from_list/1](#from_list-1)
  - [get/2](#get-2)
  - [set/3](#set-3)
  - [delete/2](#delete-2)
  - [update/3](#update-3)
  - [map/3](#map-3)
  - [fold/3](#fold-3)
  - [thread/2](#thread-3)
  - [merge/2](#merge-2)
  - [merge/3](#merge-3)

Keys
----
Keys is the abstraction over the Path in the nested structure that jsxd uses to address a value, keys can be:
* a `integer` in the case of array addressing **(be aware that we start at 0!)**
* a `binary` in case of object addressing
* a list of `keys` when addressing a nested value

from_list/1
------------
From list creates a valid jsdx object form a list. It transverses the structure, arrays are not changed but objects are sorted by key, duplicate keys are **not** deleted!


get/2
------------

jsxd exports `get/2` method to read data the parameters passed are a key or list of keys, it either returns `{ok, <value>}` or `not_found`.

```erlang
Object = [{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}].
{ok, 1} = jsxd:get(<<"a">>, Object).
{ok, 20} = jsxd:get([<<"b">>, 1], Object).
not_found = jsxd:get([<<"b">>, 1,2], Object).
```

get/3
------------

`get/3` is a get method with a default value, it will never not return `not_found` or a `{ok, _}` tuple but instead always a value, either the one found or the default provided.

```erlang
Object = [{<<"a">>, 1}].
1 = jsxd:get(<<"a">>, 42, Object).
42 = jsxd:get([<<"b">>, 1,2], 42, Object).
```



set/3
------------

Writing data works using the set/3 method, it follows the same rules for keys as get/2 does, in addition it will create nested objects based on the Path on the following rules:

* If the key is a non existing object `integer` it will create an array.
* If the key is a non existing object `binary` it will create an object.
* If an array index is given that isn't existing yet it will padded with `null` values.

```erlang
[null, <<"value">>] = jsxd:set(1, <<"value">>, []).
[null, [{<<"key">>, <<"value">>}]] = jsxd:set([1, <<"key">>], <<"value">>, []).
[{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 99, 30]}] = jsxd:set([<<"b">>, 1], 99, [{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}]).
```

delete/2
--------
This function simply deletes data from aÂ¯n object

update/3
-------------
Updating works the same as setting data with the difference that instead of a new value a function is defined. You can add a default value that gets set if the key is not found otherwise the object is returned unchanged.

```erlang
[{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 21, 30]}] = jsxd:update([<<"b">>, 1], fun(X) -> X+1 end, [{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}]).

[{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}] = jsxd:update([<<"b">>, 3], fun(X) -> X+1 end, [{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}]).

[{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 21, 30]}] = jsxd:update([<<"b">>, 1], fun(X) -> X+1 end, [{<<"a">>, 1}, {<<"b">>, [10, 20, 30]}]).
```

map/3
-----
Maps over an object. The mapping function gets two values, the first being the key (or index) and the second the value. Returned is the new value.

fold/3
--------
Folds over an object, in the way `foldl` or `foldr` does. Order isn't guaranteed in objects; so it uses `foldl` internally. The fold function gets three arguments, the key or index, the value and the accumulator, it returns a new accumulator.

merge/2
-------
Merges two objects, different keys of both objects are combined. If a key exists in both objects the value of the **second** object is taken.

merge/3
-------
Merges two objects, different keys of both objects are combined. If a key exists in both objects the ConflictFn is called with three parameters, the `key`, the value of the first object and the value of the second object.


thread/2
--------
This function threads an object through a list of changing functions, it's a simple utility function to help preventing huge chains of commands. The treated object is always entered as the last element of a call, valid calls are:


* {[set](#set-3), Key, Value}
* {[delete](#delete-2), Key}
* {[update](#update-3), Key, UpdateFn}
* {[update](#update-4), Key, UpdateFn, Default}
* {[map](#map-2), MapFn}
* {[merge](#merge-2), Obj1}
* {[merge](#merge-3), ConflictFn, Obj1}
